Hi, my name's Dr Archimedes Einstein and 
I'm a Doctor of Science at the University of Science

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,500
in a very famous town that you're too stupid to have heard of.

3
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:11,500
Anyway, today we're going to talk about "synergies".

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
A lot of people are worried about synergies, but I can tell you that

5
00:00:15,00 --> 00:00:16,00
statistics show

6
00:00:16,00 --> 00:00:19,00
there is no danger of increased cancer risk from synergies.

7
00:00:19.5,00 --> 00:00:21.5,00
However, it's better to be safe than sorry.

8
00:00:22,00 --> 00:00:25,00
 I'm going to demonstrate how you how we can leverage a synergy.

9
00:00:25,00 --> 00:00:26.5,00
First of all, I've got this banana

10
00:00:26.5,00 --> 00:00:29,00
This banana represents "Web 2.0" and look,

11
00:00:29,00 --> 00:00:32,00
I've written on it some "user-generated content"

12
00:00:32,00 --> 00:00:34,00
just to prove the point [LOL, WTF, You suck]

13
00:00:34,00 --> 00:00:37,00
I take my "Web 2.0" and I put it in an envelope

14
00:00:37,00 --> 00:00:39,00
marked "paradigm shift".

15
00:00:39,00 --> 00:00:44,00
OK. Very important, I put the envelope down and

16
00:00:44.5,00 --> 00:00:46,00
With a bit of "blue sky thinking"

17
00:00:46.4,00 --> 00:00:48,00
I "push the envelope"

18
00:00:48,00 --> 00:00:50,00
Then, I take my leverage mallet, and

19
00:00:50.3,00 --> 00:00:51,00
URGH!

20
00:00:51,00 --> 00:00:52,00
RGRRRRRARGRGGH!!

21
00:00:52,00 --> 00:00:53,00
EURGGGARRRRGGGRRGARGGAHAARRAGGHGRRAGAHAARGH!!!!

22
00:00:52,00 --> 00:00:56.5,00
...and there we can see a synergy, leveraged.
